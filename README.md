the main goal of this challenge is to build a container, place it into the middle of the webpage,
make the elements of the left side of it be centered and to put an image as background for the 
second side of the container and apply a color on that image.

For this project, I have implemented a single grid-container 
of 2 columns and 1 row for the desktop design and, 1column 
with 2 rows for the mobile design. 
What is special about this project, is that the list's elements have 
to be displayed horizontally for the desktop design and still for the 
same design, the items's elements have to be displayed vertically.
(Really tricky right?)  
To solve this issue, in the "<ul>" class, I have set the "display" 
property to "flex" and" <li>" class, the "display" property has the "grid" value
for the desktop version. But for the mobile version, for the " <ul>" class, 
the display property has "grid" for value.

The difficulties I have encountered here are:
-to make the background image of the second sub-container fit
well into it and how to apply a background-color on it.
-to make the list's items and sub-items be arranged correctly.
-and also to design the mobile's version of the webpage was a 
bit challenging.
-to make the container be displayed in the middle of the body
of the webpage.
