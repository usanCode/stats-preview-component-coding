For this project, I have implemented a single grid-container 
of 2 columns and 1 row for the desktop design and, 1column 
with 2 rows for the mobile design. 
What is special about this project, is that the list's elements have 
to be displayed horizontally for the desktop design and still for the 
same design, the items's elements have to be displayed vertically.
(Really tricky right?)  
To solve this issue, in the <ul> class, I have set the "display" 
property to "flex" and "li" class, the "display" property has the "grid" value
for the desktop version. But for the mobile version, for the "ul" class, 
the display property has "grid" for value.
